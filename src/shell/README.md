# Purpose
 
The purpose of this readme is to understand the peculiarities of the bash scripts. The shell scripts are structured in a way that can be distinguished into two sections, standard and variable. The standard section consists of the lines that are similar across all bash scripts except for file name change, whereas, the variable section is individual to each bash script.

```
set -o errexit
```
This statement requires that bash scripts exit whenever there is an error.
Usually, bash scripts continue to run even if one command failed.
-o errexit will prevent that from happening and will quit if any error occurs at all.

```
set -o pipefail
```
-o pipefail sets the exit code in the pipeline to the right most command to exit with a non-zero status.

```
set -o nounset
```
The -o nounset is used to error out any variable that is not defined in the script.
This requires that all variables are defined and it should not have any loose variables that are no longer needed.

```
