Exit code Rules:

1. Exit codes in this module are only given when an error has occurred, so they will all start with 'E.'
2. The letters 'wfg.' because they are coming from the workflow generator component of the code
3. A three letter code that hints at what the problem was
4. A number that can help to differentiate similar error codes
