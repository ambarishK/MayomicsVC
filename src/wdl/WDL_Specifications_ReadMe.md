# Purpose

The purpose of this readme is to understand the peculiarities of the WDL scripts. The WDL scripting structure is standard across all the scripts.

# Introduction to WDL

The Workflow Description Language (WDL) is a way to specify data processing workflows with a human-readable and -writeable syntax. WDL makes it straightforward to define analysis tasks, chain them together in workflows, and parallelize their execution. The language makes common patterns simple to express, while also admitting uncommon or complicated behavior; and strives to achieve portability not only across execution platforms, but also different types of users. Whether you are an analyst, a programmer, an operator of a production system, or any other sort of user, WDL should be accessible and understandable.
